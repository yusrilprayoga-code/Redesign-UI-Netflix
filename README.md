Slicing UI || Part 1
This figma website is inspired by a website called codedesign.dev

I realize that this website is still in its early stages and is not stable yet. My priority right now is to make web slicing as accessible as possible. I hope that this Code Design can be a useful resource for you in improving your skills as a confident and skilled developer. keep coding!
